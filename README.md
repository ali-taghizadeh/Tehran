The main idea of this repo is about building a sample Android application with the following features :
* Firebase Authentication : To create an account.
* Firebase Realtime Database : To create new locations, write comments about them and like/dislike them.
* Firebase Storage : To upload files.
* GeoFire : To search for locations.
* Google Maps API : To observe locations on the map
* RxJava : To manage above mentioned features work simultaneously.
